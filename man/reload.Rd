\title{Lazy wrapper for reloading fake package if it is already loaded}
\usage{
reload(dev = FALSE, package = fake_pkg())
}
\arguments{
\item{dev}{if TRUE, enter development mode (via `pkgload::load_all()`). If FALSE, enter default mode (via `vmisc::load_all2()`). Development mode allows newly recompiled C++ code to be included in the package, but copies the .dll file for each time it is initiated, which can cause memory overflow, especially in multisession parallel computing.}
